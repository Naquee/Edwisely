Some of these concepts include Variable Declaration Basic Syntax Data Type and Structures Flow Control Structures (Conditionals and loops) Functional Programming Object-Oriented Programming Debugging IDEs and Coding Environments In the next section of this shot, you will be given a brief introduction to these concepts. Variable declaration Variables are containers for storing data values, a memory location for a data type. Variables are created using a declaration or keyword that varies across languages. Variable names are usually alphanumeric, that is, they contain a-z and 0-9. They can also include special characters like underscore or the dollar sign. Variables can hold values of any data type supported by the programming language. This value may change during program execution.",
